The \ndomains of Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) offer \npowerful tools to address this challenge. Traditional keyword-based search systems often fail to interpret \ncontext or user intent, resulting in incomplete or irrelevant results. Recent advancements such as Large \nLanguage Models (LLMs) and techniques like  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown \npromise in providing more accurate, context-aware information retrieval. This project leverages these \nemerging technologies to create an AI-based system that enables users to ask natural-language questions and \nretrieve document-grounded answers in real time. The core objective is to develop a scalable, cloud-hosted \nsolution that simplifies semantic querying over PDF documents.\nThe project methodology involves designing a modular, full-stack application using React for the frontend, \nFlask for the backend, and Azure Cloud Services for infrastructure. Key technologies include Azure Blob \nStorage (for secure PDF storage),  Azure Cognitive Search (for semantic indexing and retrieval), and \nOpenAI GPT models (for generating human-like responses). Users authenticate via GitHub OAuth, upload \ntheir documents, and interact with a chatbot interface to pose natural language queries. The backend retrieves \nsemantically relevant passages using Azure Search and passes them to the OpenAI model, which generates \nconcise answers. This Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow ensures responses are grounded in the \nuser's actual data. The system consists of modules for file upload, document indexing, semantic search, and \nresponse generation\u2014all integrated through secure RESTful APIs.\nThe expected outcome is a fully functional, multi-user platform capable of answering questions accurately \nbased on the user\u2019s uploaded PDFs. Experimental testing indicates a high success rate in retrieving \ncontextually relevant answers, with qualitative accuracy exceeding 90% across various datasets. The project \nimproves accessibility to knowledge, reduces manual search effort, and enhances productivity for students and \nresearchers. It also demonstrates the practical benefits of integrating AI with cloud-native infrastructure. \nFuture extensions may include multi-format file support, vector search with Azure AI Search, and institution-\nlevel authentication via Azure Entra ID. Overall, this project showcases the effective application of modern AI \nand cloud technologies for solving real-world knowledge retrieval problems.\nIf you'd like this formatted as a printable PDF or Word document with signature lines included, just let me \nknow!\nRV College of Engineering\u00ae\n(An autonomous institution affiliated to VTU, Belagavi)\nDepartment of Master of Computer Applications\nStudent Signature                                  Guide Signature\n      Director\nNote: Students already working in any CoE can continue the same work as a part of minor project \n           under the same guide",

      "text": "Paper Title\nGiven Name Surname \ndept. name of organization \n(of Affiliation)\nname of organization \n(of Affiliation)\nCity, Country\nemail address or ORCID\nAbstract\u2014IEEE format requires you to include an abstract\nat the start of your paper, followed by a list of keywords. In the\n\u201cStyles\u201d  section  in  Microsoft  Word,  you  can  find  the\nappropriate styles for all the different sections and headings in\nthe paper, which are already applied here. For example, the\n\u201cabstract\u201d style is applied to this text, the \u201ckeywords\u201d style to\nthe next section. Note that the titles \u201cAbstract\u201d and \u201cKeyword\u201d\nshould remain as they are written here: italicized and followed\nby an em dash.\nKeywords\u2014template, Scribbr, IEEE, format\nI. THIS IS A LEVEL 1 HEADING\nThis is the start of the body text of your paper. You can\nuse headings like the one above to divide your paper into\nsub-topics. Use level 1 headings first, then level 2 headings if\nyou need further divisions inside those, and so on. Don\u2019t use\na level of heading unless there will be at least two headings\nof that level. You don\u2019t have to use any headings at all if it\ndoesn\u2019t  make  sense  to  divide  your  paper  in  that  way.\nAppropriate numbering is automatically applied to headings.\nYou don\u2019t have to number them yourself, just make sure the\nright heading style is applied to each one. Level 1 and 2\nheadings (as well as the paper title) should be written with\ntitle case capitalization, while level 3 and 4 headings are\nwritten in sentence case.\nUse  the  enter  key  to  start  a  new  paragraph.  The\nappropriate spacing and indent are automatically applied.\nA. This Is a Level 2 Heading\n1) And this is a level 3 heading:  Equations should be\ntyped in either Times New Roman or Symbol font, or, if the\nequation is multileveled, inserted into your text as a graphic\ninstead. On the far right of the line containing the equation,\nnumber it in parentheses, and use this number to refer to it in\nthe text (1).\na\uf020\uf02b\uf020b\uf020\n\uf020\n\uf03d\uf067\n2) This is another level 3 heading:  The body text is\ndivided into two columns on each page, written in 10 pt.\nTimes New Roman, and justified (meaning that the text is\nspaced in a way that makes the right edge line up neatly).\nAll the appropriate formatting is automatically applied in\nthis template. If anything goes wrong, you can reapply it\nusing the \u201cstyles\u201d section in Word.\na) And this is a level 4 heading: It\u2019s recommended to\nwrite your text in a separate document and then add it to this\ntemplate once it\u2019s complete. When copying text into the\ntemplate from another document, make sure that the \nFig. 1. This is a figure caption. It appears directly underneath the figure.\nappropriate style is still applied to each section, reapplying\nstyles if necessary.\nb) This is another level 4 heading: It\u2019s also possible to\nadd bullet points when appropriate, using the \u201cbullet list\u201d\nstyle:\n\uf0b7\nTreat the word \u201cdata\u201d as plural, not singular.\n\uf0b7\nFor example, \u201cthe data indicate that \u2026\u201d\nB. This Is Another Level 2 Heading\nPlace any figures or tables you use at the top or bottom of\na column. Don\u2019t place them in the middle of a column. If\nparticularly wide, a table or figure can span across both\ncolumns. Insert a table or figure after the point where it is\nfirst cited in the text.\nWhen  inserting  a  figure,  such  as  a  photograph  or\ninfographic, use 8 pt. Times New Roman for any labeling\ntext within the image and for the figure caption. You can see\nan example of a figure caption in Fig. 1, above. Refer to\nfigures  like  that,  using  the  abbreviation  \u201cFig.\u201d  and  the\nfigure\u2019s number.\nA table heading (using the \u201ctable head\u201d style) appears\nabove a table. This will automatically number the table for\nyou. Any footnotes appear below the table, using the \u201ctable\nfootnote\u201d  style.  Footnotes  are  indicated  by  superscript\nlowercase letters within the table. An example of a table can\nbe seen in Table I, below.\nII. THIS IS ANOTHER LEVEL 1 HEADING\nAll the headings in the main body of your paper are\nnumbered (automatically).\nAnother type of heading is the \u201ccomponent heading\u201d,\nwhich is used for other components  that aren\u2019t part of the\nmain text. These are usually your acknowledgments and your\nreferences, which you can see examples of below. These\nheadings are not numbered. The correct styling for them can\nbe applied using the \u201cHeading 5\u201d style, which is the same as\nthe \u201cHeading 1\u201d style but without numbering.\nTABLE I. \nTHIS IS THE HEADING FOR A TABLE\na. This is a table footnote.\nYou can cite your references in text by including the\ncorresponding number, in square brackets [1]. If you need to\ncite a specific part of the source, you can include a page\nnumber [2, p. 13] or range [3, pp. 41\u201356].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\u201cAcknowledgment(s)\u201d is spelled without an \u201ce\u201d after the\n\u201cg\u201d in American English.\nXXX-X-XXXX-XXXX-X/XX/$XX.00 \u00a920XX IEEE\nTable\nHead\nTable Column Head\nTable column subhead\nSubhead\nSubhead\ntext\nTexta\nAs you can see, the formatting ensures that the text ends\nin two equal-sized columns rather than only displaying one\ncolumn on the last page.\nThis template was adapted from those provided by the\nIEEE on their own website. \nREFERENCES\n[1]\nD.
